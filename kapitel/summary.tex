\chapter{Conclusion} \label{conclusion}
\section{Summary}
The prototype application which was implemented contains a smart city which can be explored freely as well as a laboratory scene which represents the job role of the software engineer. The job role of a cyber security specialist was designed and a storyboard was scripted but we could not implement the scene because it would have been too extensive in the scope of this work. \\
There were user tests to prove whether the application helps students and prospectives in understanding their future job roles in the IT industry. The outcome of the tests show positive results. Participants rated their knowledge of the software engineer job role higher after playing the VR prototype. They could also imagine more to work as a software engineer compared to the state before playing the application. However the study is based on the subjective perception of the participants and the results would have been more accurate if there was a higher number of test persons. Unfortunately it was not possible to set up a test with a wider and more objective extent. This would have been gone beyond the scope of this work.\\
We must not forget that the aim was to develop a prototype, not a full application. This objective was fulfilled. It is shown through the user test results that the prototype creates higher interest in the software engineer job role. The methods and concepts used for the implementation of this work's prototype can be reused to implement the remaining job roles.

\section{Outlook}
This project will be continued by other students of NYP. 
This work shows that it is possible to create a virtual experience which lets users explore real life jobs on first hand. There is no need to rely on passive reports from professionals or doing a time consuming internship.  The idea of using VR to simulate job roles can be extended to other industries. Through applications similar to this work, the interest in job roles with a less positive reputation,  like nursing or crafting, could be increased.\\
We can see from the outcome of this work, that with VR technologies it is possible to create immersive experience which cannot be created by other media. Because VR is currently a highly researched topic, there will be cheaper and more powerful hardware available on the market in future to create even more immerse virtual experiences.
