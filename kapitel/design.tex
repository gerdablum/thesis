\section{Main story}
To gain the users attention and let them grow interest in the application it is important to have a good main story. The main story will create a bridge between the several IT courses displayed in the application.
\\
The application will start in the so called ``Smart City''. This is a futuristic urban environment in which the user can move around freely.There are five different buildings along the streets. Each building is interactive and represents a course offered by the NYP. By interacting with the buildings the user can enter laboratories, so called ``labs'', and complete different tasks. Every successful completion of a task has an impact to the main story. \\
The main goal of the VR application is to create a delivery drone which will deliver orders from online shops, just like Amazon announced in a video of 2013 (source). This is still a vision of future for now, but it is a good showcase for the user to show them how they can impact the future with IT. During the completion of the labs several challenges will occur. Once the user started programming their first drone, a lot more drones will start flying around in Smart City. To avoid crashing and chaos, the next task is to provide a proper and stable internet connection to the drones, so they can communicate. But the connected drones have their advantages and disadvantages: At first they will fly normally and communicate to each other but then an unknown IoT-Hacker infiltrates a virus into the drone firmware, so they start to misbehave. Now the user has to trace the hacker with basic cyber security concepts. After the hacker was found, more and more inhabitants of Smart City start to use the drones and provide a lot of data. It is now the job of the user to analyse this data and optimise the drones.
