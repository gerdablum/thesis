\chapter{Introduction and goals}
The purpose of this thesis is to develop a virtual reality (VR) application for students and prospects to experience different professions in the IT industry. 
The decision about the specialization of the education can be very challenging for prospective students because it has a great impact for their future. Schools and universities struggle to provide comprehensive information about the courses and especially for the related job roles. This thesis investigates, how the usage of VR can support prospective students  by allowing them to experience the different professions in the IT industry and giving them an overview of the courses that are required to obtain a higher-eduction degree in the IT area.





%The advantages of using VR to give information about future job roles are the less costs, less time consuming and yet a nearly real experience for users. The objective of this thesis is not only to give a theoretical research but also to develop a prototype of a VR application for prospective students. 

\section{Motivation}
A lack of missing information about future professions can result in high drop out rates, as seen in \cite{UlrichHeublein.Juni2017}, a study about dropout rates in Germany and their reasons: \\ In total, about one third (32\%) left German universities without a degree in 2016. Most of the students quit their programme because of too high requirements and difficulties in the exams (30\%). The second important reason was a lack of motivation (17\%).  15\% of the dropouts lacked practical experience in their studies.
The second and third most important reasons for a university dropout together is with over one third a very large group, but could be avoidable. With missing imagination and information about the profession the students are later able to work in, the endurance might not be very high. As a conclusion, motivation lacks occur and it is harder for the students to get through more theoretical parts of their studies. It is also shown in the study that gaining information about the programme before applying for a course results in less amounts of university dropouts. \\
The question is now: How to provide prospective students suitable information for the profession of their desired programme? And more important: How is it possible to engage students in getting to know their future job roles?
\section{Goals}
There are many ways to get information about IT courses and IT job roles. For example, it is possible to read articles, watch a video or ask experienced persons. All those approaches give information about IT job roles but they provide it in a passive way. Prospective students should actively be involved in their future IT professions and experience the responsibilities and challenges of the job roles themselves. The media described above are not able to involve the user from a first person's view. \\
VR describes a computer generated 3D environment which can be experienced by users. Users are wearing a special headset through which they are fully shielded off from the real surroundings. It is possible to get an immerse and real experience of the virtual environment, and users feel as they are actually present in the virtual world. \cite{Linowes.2015}\\
With the usage of VR, it is possible to provide prospective students a visualization of their future professions and they are able to experience the job roles themselves. This thesis aims to connect the medium VR with the topic of student acquisition. It should help students in getting a better experience for the different IT professions. Universities can bring the various fields of IT closer to prospective students by providing a VR application which simulates various IT job roles.

\section{Approach}
The core target group are prospective students in Singapore, who finished their secondary education and start with a higher-eduction degree at a polytechnic.\\
The approach is to develop a VR prototype, which introduces and simulates several IT job roles. This application will provide information about the responsibilities and the daily life in a IT job role. The application will also contain user interactions. Users will complete tasks which are connected to the various IT job roles. The application is designed to follow a learning-by-doing approach. The success of the VR prototype application relies on the design, the storyline and the interactivity, not only on the usage of VR itself. Therefore the application will be designed with a focus on user interactivity and a good story line.\\
To measure how much the application helps students in improving their understanding of IT job roles, the application will also be tested. A questionnaire will be developed to see, how the understanding of IT job roles has changed. The two comparing states will be before and after playing the VR application.\\
The goal of this work is not to implement a complete ready-for-use application which contains all job roles of the IT industry. Instead, a prototype should be implemented which contains the simulation of one or two IT job roles. The experiences made during the implementation process and the results of the user tests should be seen as the results of this work and the base for further implementations.

\section{Hypotheses about advantages of VR for prospective students}
Within the VR application prospective students should not only learn about IT professions but also experience the various job roles.\\
VR can create virtual environments in which users experience a stronger feeling of presence than compared to other media. Therefore it is expected that VR helps prospective students to dive into the job roles and provide a realistic overview about the IT professions. We expect that students will show more interests in IT job roles after playing the VR application than they did before playing. \\
VR is a currently researched topic in information technology. Students are able to use technologies, which they later get into closer touch with. The idea is to arouse interest in the technology behind VR and make students want to develop their own application. Prospective students can profit as well from the cheaper and less time consuming approach in getting to know a future job role, compared to an internship. 

\section{Overview of the thesis}
In chapter \ref{stateofarts} we give an overview about basic VR technologie and current developments. Common problems which occur when designing a VR application as well as their solutions will be described. Following, in chapter \ref{design}, we will design a storyline for the application and evaluate suitable best practices in hardware and software technology. The next step will be to implement a prototype VR application in chapter \ref{implementation}. This application should provide information about the different IT job roles related to the IT diploma courses at Nanyang Polytechnic. Following, there will be a user study to test the user experience as well as the main hypothesis. The focus will be set on how their expectations about IT job roles changes after playing the VR application. Chapter \ref{testing} sums up the test procedure and the results. In conclusion, we will evaluate the whole project under the aspect of fulfilling the purpose of helping prospective students in understanding their future job roles in chapter \ref{conclusion}.
